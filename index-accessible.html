                  As an anonymous internet user once asked, on a now defunct
                  blogspot: &quot;What is so compelling about this pile of rocks
                  that would inspire me to look at this picture so many times on
                  any given day?&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sisu is a word from the Finnish language that is
                  &quot;ekphrastically untranslatable&quot;. (This means that
                  there isn‚Äôt a word quite like it in the English language.)
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It stands for a combination of resilience, determination,
                      making a plan and sticking to it, and continuing on
                      against the odds. It has often been described as similar
                      to &quot;grit&quot; or &quot;equanimity&quot; but ‚Äî I love
                      this part ‚Äî with a ‚Äúgrimmer quality of stress management.‚Äù
