  - ü™® * p.s. About the rocks. These are the "Monument to Finnish Sisu". üá´üáÆ
    - As an anonymous internet user once asked, on a now defunct blogspot: "What is so compelling about this pile of rocks that would inspire me to look at this picture so many times on any given day?"
    - Sisu is a word from the Finnish language that is "ekphrastically untranslatable". (This means that there isn‚Äôt a word quite like it in the English language.)
      - It stands for a combination of resilience, determination, making a plan and sticking to it, and continuing on against the odds. It has often been described as similar to "grit" or "equanimity" but ‚Äî I love this part ‚Äî with a ‚Äúgrimmer quality of stress management.‚Äù

![Monument to Finnish Sisu. Rocks are arranged into a large mound at the edge of a grassy plateau, overlooking fields, forests, and lakes, under a bright cloudy sky.](/sisu.gif)
