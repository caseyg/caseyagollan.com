Today's Indiekit progress:
1. Made a bunch of new Github Issues here: https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/issues
2. Researched and tested micropub clients, but didn't find any that I really love: https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients
3. Fixed timezone (UTC → EST)
3. (Partially) implemented Webmentions using webmention.io
4. Compared Indiekit’s JSON feed plugin with 11ty’s RSS feed, ended up going with 11ty
5. Setup Bridgy for backfeeding webmentions from social platforms (Mastodon, Bluesky, Flickr, Github) but not sure it's fully implemented yet
6. Experimented with a SvelteKit/Vercel/Neon fork instead of 11ty + IndieKit
